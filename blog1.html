                <h3 class="section3">When we see someone give the most engaging, impressive and rapport-building introduction, we immediately think they’re gifted. 

                    But in reality, there’s usually a lot of work behind it. 
                    
                    When writing your sample introduction in English, ask yourself: Who exactly am I talking to? Depending on your answer, there will be different things to include in your introduction. 
                    
                    So, what makes an introduction effective? First, it needs to be appropriate for the given setting.
                    
                    Consider, is it a formal or an informal situation? 
                    
                    Because you know that saying “Hey there! How’s it going?” is perfectly okay if you’re with a group of friends, but of course, it might come across a bit odd in a meeting with your boss. So knowing the context is important. 
                    
                    Let’s look at some ways you could introduce yourself in English based on different situations. </h3> </div>
